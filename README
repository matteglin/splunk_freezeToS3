*** QUICKSTART *** version 0.2.6

Requirements

The python script in this TA is dependant on the boto3 library - https://pypi.org/project/boto3/

A copy of this is supplied in the TA bin directory


Configuration  

1. Configure aws credentials for S3 access at the user home 

~/.aws/credentials

[default]
aws_access_key_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key=YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Credentials are stored here and can be accessed by the script as it's a more secure location than putting in the script themselves.

Credentials should be for an IAM role that has access to the destination bucket.


2. Set the destination bucket name within the script in the S3_BUCKET variable


3. Install the app on Indexers only - NOTE - this will change the default behaviour of ALL indexes to freeze to S3 once retention time has been reached. 

If you don't want every index frozen to S3, remove the default indexes.conf file from the TA before deployment.

Be sure to set the coldToFrozenScript parameter for only indexes that need to be frozen.


4. Upon restart, buckets that expire will freeze to S3
